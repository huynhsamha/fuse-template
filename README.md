# fuse-template

[Fuse React Template](http://fusetheme.com/admin-templates/react/) is a premium source, therefore I can't publish the source to Github (public). This is the build version from Fuse source, with version `2.2.0` and `3.0.0`. The reason I open this repository is to easily access the built online demo without development or rebuild the original source.
